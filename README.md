Welcome to FitLit! This is an app designed to help you keep track of you overall health/fitness! On page load, a random user is generated, along with all of their information. A user sleep, hydration, acvitivty, and friends will populate on the home page, which is where a user can see charts/graphs and a scoreboard of most steps between their friends.
